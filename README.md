# AsyncIO_Learning_Path
My learning path and also resources list for learning Python asyncio

Initial commit; will be updated gradually.
This paid course helped me to get ready:

* [Educative.oi - Python Concurrency](https://www.educative.io/courses/python-concurrency-for-senior-engineering-interviews/)

Maybe the most easy to understand and informative tutorial: 

* [Python tricks: Demystifying async, await, and asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSLDcRkgTsY)

Another neat intro:
* [A Really Gentle Introduction to Asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mb9jFAHRfw)

The list for watching - will be updated with descriptions.
