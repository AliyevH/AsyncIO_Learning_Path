# AsyncIO_Learning_Path
My learning path and also resources list for learning Python asyncio.

`[+]` sign indicates that, I watched it.

This paid course helped me to get ready: `[+]`

* [Educative.oi - Python Concurrency](https://www.educative.io/courses/python-concurrency-for-senior-engineering-interviews/)

`[+]` Maybe the most easy to understand and informative tutorial: 

* [Python tricks: Demystifying async, await, and asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSLDcRkgTsY)

`[+]`Another neat intro: 

* [A Really Gentle Introduction to Asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mb9jFAHRfw)

`[+]` The excellent cook/waiter example:

* [Python Asyncio for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDyYdZGRivgu0ASt-9cyVwXfU_E9rwhF
)

`[+]` These video playlist are from CPython Core developer and EdgeDB 
and it will explore what a hack is under the hood of asyncio: 

* [import asyncio: Learn Python's AsyncIO](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhNSoGM2ik6SIkVGXWBwerucXjgP1rHmB)

`[+]` From PyCon Israel 2019 - (no need to watch if you are going):

* [Async/Awaiting Production - Ronnie Sheer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIXiChn5j4E)

`[+]` From PyCon UK - (dropped at the beginning no need to watch if you are going):

* [Asynchronous Web Development with Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ7CnUX_7YQ)

`[+]` From Fosdem 2020 - nice slide, nice talk:

* [Asyncio: understanding async and await in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1rk64e9vCA)

`[+]` Asynchronous workers in Python - Sławomir Mucha - 4Developers (Low quality sound and video. No need to follow.):

* [Asynchronous workers in Python - Sławomir Mucha - 4Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F0CTBvHgLc)

`[+]` Coroutines and Asyncio -- A Beginner's Guide - Jacob McSwain: OKC Python.
5 minutes talk. I don't think it is worth to watch.

* [Coroutines and Asyncio -- A Beginner's Guide - Jacob McSwain: OKC Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K244l0L_mA)

`[+]` How to Speed Up Your Python Code with Asyncio (low quality video and sound - dropped)

* [How to Speed Up Your Python Code with Asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGsXiJ5BmWo)

`[+]` Demystifying Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming in Python - Nice, clean, historical view.

* [Demystifying Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoANOGIDuM)

`[+]`  How to use Asyncio or a Simple TUTORIAL on Asyncio || Playing with Asyncio -> clean toy example code.

* [How to use Asyncio or a Simple TUTORIAL on Asyncio || Playing with Asyncio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Btb5-SWeM8)

`[+]` The nice, concise talk about internals of coroutines and CPython VM - extremely valuable.

* ["What is a Coroutine Anyway?" - John Reese (North Bay Python 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSiZkP7cI80)

`[+]` Great talk about asyncio usage - learned a lot:

* [Lynn Root - Advanced asyncio: Solving Real-world Production Problems - PyCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bckD_GK80oY
)

`[+]` Nice talk - shows topics with their downsides etc - explains aiomultiprocess

* [John Reese - Thinking Outside the GIL with AsyncIO and Multiprocessing - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXaLh8Fz3k)

`[+]` Nothing special ignored immediately

[concurrency in python | python asyncio | python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6lPNa-9y-U)

`[+]` Very nice talk and showcase clear explanation - using Trio - but do not worry the idea is the same.

[Nathaniel J. Smith - Trio: Async concurrency for mere mortals - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE)

`[+]` Nice talk - explains how things work with Python >= 3.7

[asyncio: what's next | Yury Selivanov @ PyBay2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vem5GHboRNM)
